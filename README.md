LinkedIn Hiring Posts Scraper
This Python script automates the process of logging into LinkedIn, searching for posts related to "hiring" in the Gurgaon area from the last 15 days, and extracting the relevant post content and links. The scraped data is then saved into an Excel file.

Features
Automated LinkedIn Login: The script automates the process of logging into LinkedIn using the Selenium WebDriver.
Search for Specific Posts: It searches for posts containing the keywords "hiring" and "Gurgaon" within the last 15 days.
Post Content Extraction: The script extracts the content and links of relevant posts and saves them in an Excel file.
Data Export: The extracted data is exported to an Excel file (linkedin_hiring_gurgaon_posts.xlsx) for further analysis or reporting.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Required Python libraries:
selenium
pandas
time
You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install selenium pandas
Additionally, you need to have ChromeDriver installed and available in your system PATH. If you're using Homebrew on a Mac, you can install ChromeDriver with:

bash
Copy code
brew install chromedriver
Setup
Clone the Repository: First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/linkedin-hiring-scraper.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd linkedin-hiring-scraper
Configure the Script:

Replace the placeholder email (example@email.com) and password (password) in the script with your actual LinkedIn credentials.
Ensure the chrome_driver_path variable in the script is correctly pointing to the path where ChromeDriver is installed.
Run the Script:

Execute the script by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

bash
Copy code
python linkedin_hiring_scraper.py
How It Works
LinkedIn Login: The script opens a Chrome browser window, navigates to the LinkedIn login page, and logs in using the provided credentials.
Search for Posts: It then navigates to a LinkedIn search URL that filters posts containing "hiring" and "Gurgaon" keywords from the last 15 days.
Scrolling: The script scrolls down the page multiple times to load more posts.
Post Scraping: The script iterates through the posts, extracting the post links and content that contain the keyword "hiring."
Data Export: The extracted post content and links are saved into an Excel file named linkedin_hiring_gurgaon_posts.xlsx.
Clean Up: The script closes the browser and exits.
Important Notes
Manual Login: The script automates login but requires the correct credentials. Ensure you have no two-factor authentication or CAPTCHA challenges active, as they may interrupt the process.
Element Selectors: LinkedInâ€™s UI may change over time, which could require updates to the XPath selectors used in the script.
Data Privacy: Handle your LinkedIn credentials with care. Consider using environment variables or a secure method to store your credentials instead of hardcoding them in the script.
Example Output
After running the script, the Excel file (linkedin_hiring_gurgaon_posts.xlsx) will contain columns for the post links and post content that matched the search criteria.
